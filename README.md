# Using GitHub Actions to deploy serverless applications
Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) is one of the major DevOps components. This allows you to build, test, and deploy your applications rapidly and reliably, while improving quality and reducing time to market.

GitHub is an AWS Partner Network (APN) with the AWS DevOps Competency. GitHub Actions is a GitHub feature that allows you to automate tasks within your software development lifecycle. You can use GitHub Actions to run a CI/CD pipeline to build, test, and deploy software directly from GitHub.

The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings. With a few lines per resource, you can define the application you want and model it using YAML.

During deployment, AWS SAM transforms and expands the AWS SAM syntax into AWS CloudFormation syntax, enabling you to build serverless applications faster. The AWS SAM CLI allows you to build, test, and debug applications locally, defined by AWS SAM templates. You can also use the AWS SAM CLI to deploy your applications to AWS. For AWS SAM example code, see the serverless patterns collection.
